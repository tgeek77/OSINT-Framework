## OSINT Frame.work

**New site:** http://osintframe.work

### Notes
OSINT Frame.work focuses on gathering information from free tools or resources. The intention is to help people find free OSINT resources. Some of the sites included might require registration or offer more data for $$$, but you should be able to get at least a portion of the available information for no cost.

The original [OSINT Framework](osintframework.com) was originally created with an information security point of view. Since then, the response from other fields and disciplines has been incredible. I would love to be able to include any other OSINT resources, especially from fields outside of infosec. Please let me know about anything that might be missing!

Today:
[OSINT Frame.work](https://osintframe.work) is a new fork of OSINT Framework with the same goal of finding and providing access to OSINT tools with some new functionality and management team to help keep it up to date. This site has no cookies and no tracking. It has no advertisements and the only stored data is standard web server logs. It also does not block Tor Browser users at all, though many of the resources found here will.

### Changelog
* September 9th, 2025  -- advertisements went out on Reddit and LinkedIn. readme.md is updated and the ci/cd is simplified
