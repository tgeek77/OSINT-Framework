<p><strong>New site:</strong> <a
href="http://osintframe.work">http://osintframe.work</a></p>
<h3 id="notes">Notes</h3>
<p>OSINT Frame.work focuses on gathering information from free tools or
resources. The intention is to help people find free OSINT resources.
Some of the sites included might require registration or offer more data
for $$$, but you should be able to get at least a portion of the
available information for no cost.</p>
<p>The original <a href="https://osintframework.com">OSINT Framework</a>
was originally created with an information security point of view. Since
then, the response from other fields and disciplines has been
incredible. I would love to be able to include any other OSINT
resources, especially from fields outside of infosec. Please let me know
about anything that might be missing!</p>
<p>Today: <a href="https://osintframe.work">OSINT Frame.work</a> is a
new fork of OSINT Framework with the same goal of finding and providing
access to OSINT tools with some new functionality and management team to
help keep it up to date. This site has no cookies and no tracking. It
has no advertisements and the only stored data is standard web server
logs. It also does not block Tor Browser users at all, though many of
the resources found here will.</p>
